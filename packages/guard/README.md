# guard/ — loop-hygiene guard family

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The `guard/` group keeps the agent loop productive by watching for three common failure patterns. `repeat-tool-reminder` notices when the model repeats the exact same tool call and reminds it to change approach or finish, so a stuck loop stops burning time and tokens. `timeout-policy` puts a time limit on tool calls that declare one, so a hung call returns a clear timed-out error to the model instead of stalling the session. `context-checkpoint` notices when pinned context the work depends on was removed by compaction and reminds the model to re-obtain it, so the loop stops acting on incomplete information. `repeat-tool-reminder` and `timeout-policy` ship enabled in the `dsh` base bundle; `context-checkpoint` is opt-in per composition; a composition can tune or remove any of them.

## Packages

Three small plugins cover the three patterns; each README below explains when to keep, tune, or remove it.

| Package | What it provides |
|---|---|
| [`repeat-tool-reminder/`](repeat-tool-reminder/README.md) | Reminds the model when it repeats the same tool call, so it changes approach or finishes |
| [`timeout-policy/`](timeout-policy/README.md) | Times out tool calls that declare a limit, so the model gets a clear error instead of waiting forever |
| [`context-checkpoint/`](context-checkpoint/README.md) | Reminds the model when pinned context was compacted away, so it re-obtains the source before acting on it |
